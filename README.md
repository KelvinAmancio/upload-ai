# Upload AI

This project is the frontend developed during the [NLW AI](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/nlw) event from [Rocktseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). It involved creating a video upload tool for YouTube that automatically generates titles and descriptions using the [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation).
